        <h1>What is the purpose</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I feel that the main reason that i am doing this is to let other 
                people understand the current meta in warone to try to give them 
                a slight advantage or to be on equal footing with other people.
                Because how the current state of warzone is, is what guns you 
                are using not how good you are.</li>
